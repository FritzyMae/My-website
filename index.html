                <h2>Climate Change Advocacy</h2>
                <p>A greater knowledge of the dangers and effects of climate change on health will encourage and facilitate social support for the steps necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Improved awareness would also enable health-care professionals to take the lead in advocating for swift and comprehensive mitigation and adaptation solutions that will improve health while reducing susceptibility.</p>

                <h2>Cause of Climate Change</h2>
                <p>Example 1: Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas causes a large chunk of global emissions. Most electricity is still produced from fossil fuels; only about a quarter comes from wind, solar and other renewable sources.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <p>Raise your voice. Leaders have the power to take action on the scale required to make long-term progress on this issue, but they must first understand that it is a high priority for individuals. You can sign petitions and encourage others to do so, attend local meetings to express your support for carbon reduction and clean energy initiatives, and visit with political officials to let them know you support them. One of the most impactful activities you can take is to tell your officials that this is an issue that you care about.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p>Example 2: Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they are cut, release the carbon they have been storing. Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits natureâ€™s ability to keep emissions out of the atmosphere.</p>
